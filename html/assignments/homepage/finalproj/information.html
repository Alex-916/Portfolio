	<h2>About</h2><br>
	<p>Aftershock Festival is an annual concert sponsored by Monster Energy held in Sacramento, California that features several rock and metal acts. Beginning in 2012, the festival expanded from a one-day concert to a two-day festival. As the Festival grew more and more popular bands like Ozzy Ozbourne, Avenged Sevenfold, and Marilyn Manson started to appear.</p>
	<p>With each year that passed the ticket prices started to increase in 2012 general admission tickets costed $49.50 for two days, and by 2018 ticket went up for general admission to $149.50 (thats if you were lucky to buy the first level tickets). Tickets can vary depending on what level you buy them for general admission (GA) there are 5 levels that range from $149.50 to $225.00 as well as Saturday GA and Sunday GA with levels 1 to 3, with prices ranging from $89.50 to $120.00 for each day. There is also Weekend VIP, that go from level 1 to 3, with prices ranging $299.50 to $350.00, Saturday VIP tickets and Sunday VIP tickets that go from level 1 to level 2, prices ranging from $179.50 to $199.50 for each day. Although tickets can be quite pricey they do sell out rather quickly, so if in the near future you are intrested in attending an aftershock festival be sure to get the early bird tickets.
